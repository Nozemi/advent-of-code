# Example Inputs
This directory contains the inputs used in the examples on [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/). First line contains the expected answers for part 1 and 2 respectively.

Sometimes the example data works, but with actual data, it doesn't. So providing a file called `day00-actual.txt` for that day, makes the generator test against both. This file needs to follow same rules as the example data file, with the expected results on the first line.
